# Hash Table with Linked List Hash Chaining in C++

## What is a hash-table?

A hash table is used to fetch, add and remove an element in constant time.

Every hash-table store data in the form of a (key, value) combination. Interestingly every key is unique in a Hash Table but values can repeat which means values can be the same for different keys present in it. Now as we observe in an array to fetch a value we provide the position/index corresponding to the value in that array. In a Hash Table, instead of an index, we use a key to fetch the value corresponding to that key.

Every time a key is generated. The key is passed to a hash function. Every hash function has two parts a Hash code and a Compressor. 

Hash code is an Integer number (random or non-random). IWe will use the hash code generated by our hash function and compress the hash code we modulo(%) the hash code by the size of the hash table. So modulo operator is a compressor in our implementation.

The entire process ensures that for any key, we get an integer position within the size of the Hash Table to insert the corresponding value.

So the process is simple, the user gives a (key, value) pair set as input, and based on the value generated by the hash function an index is generated to where the value corresponding to the particular key is stored. So whenever we need to fetch a value corresponding to a key, that is just O(1).

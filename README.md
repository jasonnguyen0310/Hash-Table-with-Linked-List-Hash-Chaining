What is a hash-table?

A hash table is used to fetch, add and remove an element in constant time.

Every hash-table store data in the form of a (key, value) combination. Interestingly every key is unique in a Hash Table but values can repeat which means values can be the same for different keys present in it. Now as we observe in an array to fetch a value we provide the position/index corresponding to the value in that array. In a Hash Table, instead of an index, we use a key to fetch the value corresponding to that key.

Every time a key is generated. The key is passed to a hash function. Every hash function has two parts a Hash code and a Compressor. 

Hash code is an Integer number (random or non-random). IWe will use the hash code generated by our hash function and compress the hash code we modulo(%) the hash code by the size of the hash table. So modulo operator is a compressor in our implementation.

The entire process ensures that for any key, we get an integer position within the size of the Hash Table to insert the corresponding value.
